# neural_n00b
#### Neural Network from the scratch implementation.

#### The main idea of the NN is education purpose.


#### Before you start 
Creating a virtual environment in Python using venv is a great way to manage project-specific dependencies and avoid conflicts with system packages.

- make sure if you have __init__.py in your 'src'
- python3 -m venv ./myenv
- source myenv/bin/activate
- RExecute the next command from your project dir - export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:./" 
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt


TODO:
- add different activation functions and derivatives 
- add visualisation for the NN
- visualisation and add 3 lists (LOSS, Acuracy for validation dataset and test dataset) matplotlib or streamlit.
